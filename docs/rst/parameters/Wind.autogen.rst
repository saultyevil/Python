Wind.old_windfile

The rootname of a previously saved model in a calculation one wishes to
continue (with the possiblity of making changes to some of the details of
the radiation sources, or to extract spectra from different inclinations)

**Type:** String

**Parent(s):**

* :ref:`System_type`: previous


**File:** python.c


Wind.ionization
===============
Multi-line description, must keep indentation.

**Type:** Enumerator

**Values:**

LTE_te
  Multi-line description, must keep indentation.

  Multi-line description, must keep indentation.

  Multi-line description, must keep indentation.

  Multi-line description, must keep indentation.

on.the.spot
  Multi-line description, must keep indentation.


**File:** setup.c


Wind.fixed_concentrations_file
------------------------------
The filename for the fixed ion concentrations if you have
set Wind_ionization to 2 (fixed). This file has format
[atomic_number  ionizationstage   ion fraction].

**Type:** String

**Parent(s):**

* :ref:`Wind.ionization`: fixed


**File:** setup.c


Wind.radiation
==============
Whether or not the wind should radiate.

**Type:** Boolean (yes/no)

**File:** python.c


Wind.number_of_components
=========================
While most simple description of a wind consist of a single region of space, Python can calculate
radiative transfer through more complicated structres, where one region of space is described with one
prescription and another region of space with a second prescription. For example, one might want to place
a disk atmoosphere between the disk and a wind.  This parameter describes the number of components (aka domains)
of the wind.

**Type:** Integer

**Values:** Greater than 0

**Parent(s):**

* :ref:`System_type`: ``star``, ``binary``, ``agn``


**File:** python.c


Wind.t.init
-----------
Starting temperature of the wind.

**Type:** Double

**Unit:** Kelvin

**Values:** Greater than 0

**Parent(s):**

* :ref:`Wind.number_of_components`: Greater than 0. Once per domain.


**File:** setup_domains.c


Wind.coord_system
-----------------
The coordinate system used for a describing a component of the wind.

**Type:** Enumerator

**Values:**

spherical
  Spherical

cylindrical
  Cylindrical

polar
  Spherical polar

cyl_var
  Cylindrical varying z


**Parent(s):**

* :ref:`Wind.number_of_components`: Greater than 0. Once per wind.


**File:** setup_domains.c


Wind.radmax
-----------
Multi-line description, must keep indentation.

**Type:** Double

**Unit:** cm

**Values:** Greater than :ref:`Central_object.radius` and any minimum wind radii in the system.

**Parent(s):**

* :ref:`Wind.number_of_components`: Greater than 0. Once per domain.


**File:** setup_domains.c


Wind.filling_factor
-------------------
The volume filling factor of the outflow. The implementation
of clumping (microclumping) is described in
Matthews et al. (2016), 2016MNRAS.458..293M. Asked once per domain.

**Type:** Double

**Values:** 0 < f <= 1, where 1 is a fully smooth wind.

**Parent(s):**

* :ref:`Wind.number_of_components`: Greater than 0. Once per domain.


**File:** setup_domains.c


Wind.dim.in.z_or_theta.direction
--------------------------------
Winds are calulated on spherical, cylindrical, or polar grids.
This input variable gives the size of the grid in the z or theta
direction.  Because some grid cells are used as a buffer, the
actual wind cells are contained in a slightly smaller grid than
the number given.

Note that in some situations there may be more than one wind
component, known technically as a domain.  In that case the user
will be queried for this value mulitple times, one for each domain

**Type:** Integer

**Values:** Greater than 0

**Parent(s):**

* :ref:`Wind.number_of_components`: Greater than 0. Once per wind.

* :ref:`Wind.type`: Not imported


**File:** setup_domains.c


Wind.type
---------
Multi-line description, must keep indentation.

**Type:** Enumerator

**Values:**

SV
  Multi-line description, must keep indentation.

corona
  Multi-line description, must keep indentation.

homologous
  Multi-line description, must keep indentation.

hydro
  Multi-line description, must keep indentation.

imported
  Multi-line description, must keep indentation.

kwd
  Multi-line description, must keep indentation.

shell
  Multi-line description, must keep indentation.

star
  Multi-line description, must keep indentation.

yso
  Multi-line description, must keep indentation.


**Parent(s):**

* :ref:`Wind.number_of_components`: Greater than 0. Once per domain.


**File:** setup_domains.c


Wind.mdot
^^^^^^^^^
Multi-line description, must keep indentation.

**Type:** Double

**Unit:** Mâ˜‰/year

**Values:** Greater than 0

**Parent(s):**

* :ref:`Wind.type`: ``knigge``, ``SV``


**File:** ['knigge.c', 'sv.c']


Wind.model2import
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The name of a file to containing a generic model to read in to python from an ascii file.  (Note
that this is not the same as reading in a model generated by python, but is intended to allow
one to read in a generic model in a variety of formats with only a limited amount of information
required).

**Type:** String

**Parent(s):**

* :ref:`Wind.type`: imported


**File:** import.c


Wind.dim.in.x_or_r.direction
----------------------------
Winds are calulated on spherical, cylindrical, or polar grids.
This input variable gives the size of the grid in the x or r
direction.  Because some grid cells are used as a buffer, the
actual wind cells are contained in a slightly smaller grid than
the number given.

Note that in some situations there may be more than one wind
component, known technically as a domain.  In that case the user
will be queried for this value mulitple times, one for each domain

**Type:** Integer

**Values:** Greater than or equal to 4, to allow for boundaries.

**Parent(s):**

* :ref:`Wind.number_of_components`: Greater than or equal to 0. Once per wind.

* :ref:`Wind.type`: Not imported
