low_energy_break
================
This is a command to define a cloudy type broken power
law SED - mainly used for testing the code against cloudy.
This SED has hardwired frequency exponents of 2.5 below the
low energy break and -2.0 above the high energy break. This
parameter defines the energy of the low energy break.

**Type:** Double

**Unit:** eV

**Values:** Greater than 0

**Parent(s):**

* :ref:`BH.radiation`: ``True``

* :ref:`BH.rad_type_to_make_wind`: cloudy_table
