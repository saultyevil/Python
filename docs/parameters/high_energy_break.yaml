name: high_energy_break
description: |
  This is a command to define a cloudy type broken power
  law SED - mainly used for testing the code against cloudy.
  This SED has hardwired frequency exponents of 2.5 below the
  low energy break and -2.0 abov e the high energy break. This
  parameter defines the energy of the high energy break.
type: Double
unit: eV
values: Greater than :ref:`low_energy_break`
parent:
  BH.radiation: true
  BH.rad_type_to_make_wind: cloudy_table
