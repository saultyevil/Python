name: low_energy_break
description: |
  This is a command to define a cloudy type broken power
  law SED - mainly used for testing the code against cloudy.
  This SED has hardwired frequency exponents of 2.5 below the
  low energy break and -2.0 above the high energy break. This
  parameter defines the energy of the low energy break.
