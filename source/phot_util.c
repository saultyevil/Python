 * @brief  
 * This file contains utilities which can be used to work with photon structues.  It also
 * contains routines to calculate the distances to intersections of spheres and cones.  The
 * routines included here should not be tightly tied to a particular wind model.   The one
 * exception at present is ds_to_cone which calculates the distance to a bifurcated cone.

/** @name      quadratic

 *
 * @param [in] double  a   The constant which multiples x**2 in the quadratic equation
 * @param [in] double  b   The constant which multiples x
 * @param [in] double  c   The constant 
 * @param [out] double  r[]   The roots of the quadratic equation
 * @return   The returns depend on the a status tha depends on the nature of the solutions
 * The return is set up
 *    to make it easy to identify the smallest positive root if one exists.  The routine returns
 *    a negative number if both roots are negative or imaginary.  More specifically the routine returns
 *  *  -1 -> both roots are imaginary
 *  * -2 -> both roots are negative or 0
 *  * 0 -> the first root is the smallest positive  root
 *  * 1 -> the second root is the smallest positive root
 *
