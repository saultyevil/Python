# Standard Regression Tests

This directory contains standard regression tests for Python.

The regression tests are run with the routine regression.py

The tests are relatively short and none (or very few) of the models
approach anything like convergence.  They are instead intended 
to check whether something gross has changed in the program.

Note that the file commands.txt allows one to apply switches to
the various individual tests. If commands.txt exists, but  there 
is no command for a particular  .pf file, then it is run w/out 
any switches.
